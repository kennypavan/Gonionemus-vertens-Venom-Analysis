# Gonionemus vertens
Venomics and transcriptome analysis pipeline and corresponding data. <br><br>

## Raw Data
Mi-Seq raw fq paired data can be downloaded from the following links. Two distinct Mi-Seq runs were performed on 5 individual GV samples resulting in 10 pairs of forward and reverse reads. The individual reads were then concatenated into holistic forward and reverse files which can be downloaded below.
